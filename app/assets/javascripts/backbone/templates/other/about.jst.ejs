<h1 class="t1">what is trender.io?</h1>
<div class="columns">
  <p>Trender.io will aim to find the top trending topics and objectively deliver the best sources to read about them. Currently there is a number of locations individuals go to where they source these stories (Facebook, twitter, CNN) but each of these sites has a bias (what their friends are sharing and what CNN classes as the best news may be neither the most important news nor the best place to read about it). Another example of bias is geographical preference - the BBC is likely to classify UK news as more important than CNN would. Our aim is to analyze the trending topics in addition to the best place to read these, and deliver these to the reader in a simple, transparent way.</p>

<h1 class="t2">how does it work?</h1>
<p>There are two main categories of data that we will collect:
<br/><strong>- Trending data: twitter, LinkedIn, Google News, Bing News, HackerNews</strong>
<br/>This is where we will find out what topics are trending. These will be gathered mainly through APIs, though in some occasions through XML (for example with Google News) Facebook's Open Graph API is not available for college projects and therefore will not be available to us.
<br/><strong>- Story data: CNN, ABC, BBC News, WSJ, FT</strong>
<br/>This is where we will find the news stories, most likely through XML feeds.
