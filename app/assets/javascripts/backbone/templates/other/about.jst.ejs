				<p>Trender.io will aim to find the top trending topics and objectively deliver the best sources to read about them. Currently there is a number of locations individuals go to where they source these stories (Facebook, twitter, CNN) but each of these sites has a bias (what their friends are sharing and what CNN classes as the best news may be neither the most important news nor the best place to read about it). Another example of bias is geographical preference - the BBC is likely to classify UK news as more important than CNN would. Our aim is to analyze the trending topics in addition to the best place to read these, and deliver these to the reader in a simple, transparent way.</p>

		<h1>how does it work?</h1>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-4">
				<p>There are two main categories of data that we will collect: trending data and story data. trender.ioâ€™s special algorythmic glue matches and transparently delivers the best news to you through the front-end, and we're open to suggestions for improvement through our github account.
